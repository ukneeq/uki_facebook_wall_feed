uki_facebook_wall_feed
======================

PHP code to add your Facebook wall feed to any website or blog

I wrote this code originally to solve the problem of how to include my facebook wall on my wordpress blog (http://fedil.ukneeq.com/). I wrote it so that it could be used on any web page or website. The code was then used by [Takanudo](http://takanudo.com) to create a [facebook wall wordpress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jsl3-facebook-wall-feed/).

I have not maintained this code since so it is out of date. Facebook has changed it's Open Graph APIs and also changed looks several times. So if anyone wanted to take this back up and update it, you are more than welcome to. I decided to post the files here to get it off my server and to have easily accessible examples of my work.
